# Interactive-Dashboard-for-Technical-Analysis
We are creating an interactive dashboard for technical analysis of tech stocks listed on the NASDAQ using Bollinger Bands, Relative Strength Index and Moving Average Convergence-Divergence.
Edit: The widget is not visible in the browser due to technical issues. You can download the code and run it as a Jupyter Notebook to see the results.
